# Online store "Your Solution" website
This GitHub repository contains the source code and files for the prototype version of a website for a company called "Your Solution". 
The website's design and development was done by me, as part of of a software development course and it also has a design documentation of 172 pages.

The website is an online store that sells washing machines with the aim of providing a fast and reliable solution for people whose washing machines break down.
The new website prototype includes features that allow users to browse products, see stock availability, add products to their shopping basket, and contact the store. The website works in conjunction with a database, and the live stock is available to see for users.
The website has an option for managers to log in with their ID and view and print reports. 

The website was designed to current web standards using up-to-date technologies and accessible and responsive design techniques.
